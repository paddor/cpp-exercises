Just my attempt to keep it simple.

Usage
-----

Every sub directory should contain a Makefile with a useful default target that
shows the point of the whole exercise. So just run `make` in the respective sub
directory.

Prerequisites
-------------

The compiler command used is `llvm-g++`, so you'll need the LLVM toolchain. On
Mac (with Homebrew), install it with `brew install llvm`.
